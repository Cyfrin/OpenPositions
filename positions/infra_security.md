- Experience with security tools and technologies (SIEM, EDR, vulnerability scanners, etc.)
- Proven ability to implement security frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, CIS benchmarks)
- Experience with infrastructure as code and automation (Terraform, Ansible, etc.)

- Experience with compliance and regulatory requirements (SOC2, etc.)
- Security certifications (CISSP, CISM, SANS, etc.)
- Background in financial services or high-security environments
- Interest in fitness - we often do weightlifting or CrossFit as a team! (also you may need to carry a server from time to time...)

## Leadership Opportunities:
